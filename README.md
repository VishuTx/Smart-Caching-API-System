**Smart Caching API System**
A RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Redis, designed to implement intelligent caching for high-performance applications.

This Smart Caching API System is intended for use cases where fast data access and optimized performance are essential. For instance, in an e-commerce platform or any service with frequent data retrieval—such as fetching product details, user profiles, or public listings—querying the database on every request can lead to latency and high resource usage.

To address this, the system integrates Redis to cache frequently accessed data:

When a user requests a product, the API checks Redis for cached data.

# If the product is cached, the response is returned immediately—avoiding a database query.

If not, the data is fetched from MongoDB, returned to the user, and stored in Redis for future requests.

The system also maintains data consistency. Any changes to the data—through updates or deletions—automatically trigger cache invalidation or updates to ensure users always receive the most current information.

Features
Read-through caching for enhanced response times

Automatic cache invalidation to maintain synchronization with the database

RESTful API endpoints for managing product data

MongoDB integration for persistent storage

Redis integration for high-speed caching

Caching System
The caching mechanism is implemented as follows:

Upon receiving a GET request, the system first checks Redis for a cached response.

If a cached result is found, it is returned immediately.

If no cache is found, the request is processed, the response is sent to the client, and the result is cached in Redis.

When data is modified using POST, PUT, or DELETE, the corresponding cache entries are invalidated to ensure consistency.
